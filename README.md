# ReducerContext_StarWarsAPI

--- This project is a test ---

This is a `React` test app that uses the `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useContext` hooks to get data from the `SWAPI API` and display it in a card format. It is composed of a navbar with a button to get all the data from the API, handled by a `reducer`, and a main section that displays the data in card format. The component also uses `context` to store and access the data from the API.

I used `tailwind.css` framework to style the app.
